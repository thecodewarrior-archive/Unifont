Old, spread across various files to denote various properties (combining, nonprinting, etc.):
```
[codepoint]:[glyph]
```

New, spread across various files, one for each unicode block (Latin, Alchemical Symbols, Greek Extended, etc.):
```
; Block: [Block Name]
; Range: [start]..[end]
[codepoint]:[glyph]; [flag] [attr]=[value] [attr]="[value]"
...
; Unassigned: [start]..[end]
; Unassigned: [codepoint]
...
; Missing Glyph: [start]..[end]
; Missing Glyph: [codepoint]
...
```

NOTES:

To go to the legacy format, remove everything after the semicolon and remove empty lines

The glyph hex can be empty, which is equivalent to a zero-width character

attributes:
- blank_width=single|double -> marks a glyph as a blank glyph of the specified width. Useful for spaces
- combining=[offset] -> marks a glyph as a combining character offset to the left by the specified (positive) value
- width_override=[width] -> manually overrides glyph width
- name=[name] -> Specifies the unicode name for the glyph

flags:
- np -> marks a glyph as a nonprinting character
- ignore_empty -> the program will not complain about empty glyphs that have this tag
